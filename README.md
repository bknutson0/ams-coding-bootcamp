# Outline 

- Command line interface (CLI)
    - Why: To use git and github, and remote access
    - Examples: Bash (Linux/MacOS), PowerShell (Windows)

- Integrated development environment (IDE)
    - Why: Code in unified workspace
    - Examples: RStudio, MATLAB, PyCharm, Spyder, VSCode

- Version control
    - Why: Never lose code, and track history
    - Examples: Git, GitHub

- Jupyter notebook
    - Why: Execute code in chunks, display output, and add math
    - Examples: JupyterLab, Google Colab
    
- Environment manager
    - Why: Make code reproducible
    - Examples: conda, uv

- Formatter/linter
    - Why: Make code clean and consistent
    - Examples: isort, black, ruff

- Testing
    - Why: Ensure code is working as intended
    - Examples: pytest, GitHub Action

- AI coding tools
    - Why: Pair coding with an intelligent LLM is the way of the future
    - Examples: GitHub Copilot (student developer pack)
